# Ion

Ion is a Vulkan Render Engine, made just to learn something about this new graphic API.
I'm not a render or engine programmer and this work MUST NOT BE USED for any commercial purpose.

> Ion in the Greek Mythology is the illegitimate child of Cre√ºsa, daughter of Erechtheus and wife of Xuthus


## Status

**[X64] WORKING**

I'm not planning to do a x86 version

This is a screenshot about a first test on PBR render, maybe I need a more "brighty" and "shiny" skybox to generate maps from and set some different material parameters.

<img src="./Screenshots/FirstTest.jpg">

## Controls

At the beginning you have to select the test, from 1 to 5 are generated primitives, 6 is to see the BRDFlut texture in a quad and the 7 is the DamageHelmet PBR test.

The controls in this demo test are:
* Hold left mouse button in order to rotate the object
* Hold right mouse button in order to pan right or left and up or down the object
* Use the mouse wheel to go toward or far away the object
* Press R to auto rotate the model
* Press B to toggle a fancy bounding box

To Debug PBR (this works just with the 7th test for now because is the only one using the PBR shader)
* Press 1, 2 or 3 to change the active value between esposure, gamma or prefiltered cube mip levels
* Press Q or Z to increment or decrement the selected values


## Important

As I wrote before, this is made to learn something about this API.

### Almost self inclusive

I tried to reduce external dependencies to the minimum.
All the dependencies are inside DEPENDENCIES folder.
The main dependencies at the moment are the memory allocators for CPU and GPU, made by me (Eos and vkMemoryAllocator)
Other dependencies are single file, like json and stb_image


### About dependencies

About how to use the dependencies please take a look to their own owner. (also for the mine!)
