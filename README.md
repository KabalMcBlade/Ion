# Ion

Ion is a Vulkan Render Engine, made just to learn something about this new graphic API.
I'm not a render or engine programmer and this work MUST NOT BE USED for any commercial purpose.

> Ion in the Greek Mythology is the illegitimate child of Cre√ºsa, daughter of Erechtheus and wife of Xuthus


## Important

As I wrote before, this is made to learn something about this API.
Most of the code has been studied and inspired by:
- Dustin Land (https://www.fasterthan.life/) 
	- GitHub: https://github.com/DustinHLand/vkDOOM3
- Sascha Willems (https://www.saschawillems.de/)
	- GitHub: https://github.com/SaschaWillems

For some code such initialization, setup, etc, most of the whole Vulkan base start-up, I just copied and pasted, adding or removing what I need or not.


## Status

For now it compile only and run without showing anything!
When I'll finish the interface I'll add some things to render!


### Almost self inclusive

I tried to reduce external dependencies to the minimum.
All the dependencies are inside DEPENDENCIES folder.
The main dependencies at the moment are the memory allocators for CPU and GPU, made by me (Eos and vkMemoryAllocator)
Other dependencies are single file, like json and stb_image


### About dependencies

About how to use the dependencies please take a look to their own owner. (also for the mine!)



## Example

In the Demo folder you will find a demo project using ION Library
