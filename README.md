# Ion

Ion is a Vulkan Render Engine, made just to learn something about this new graphic API.
I'm not a render or engine programmer and this work MUST NOT BE USED for any commercial purpose.

> Ion in the Greek Mythology is the illegitimate child of Cre√ºsa, daughter of Erechtheus and wife of Xuthus


## Status

**[X64] WORKING**

I'm not planning to do a x86 version

This is a screenshot about a first test on PBR render, maybe I need a more "brighty" and "shiny" skybox to generate maps from and set some different material parameters.

Using the DamagedHelmet supplied with this demo (for the license raed the end of this file)
<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot1.png">

Another PBR test (model NOT supplied by this demo, but you can download from https://sketchfab.com)
<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot2.png">

Another PBR test (model NOT supplied by this demo, but you can download from https://sketchfab.com)
In this case I have exagerate the PBR settings (See controls below)
<img src="./Screenshots/Screenshot3.png">

Instead this screenshot has taken from a NOT PBR model, to test the capabilities of my renderer to swap to the "closest" material if Physical settings are not supplied
(Again this mode is NOT supplied by this demo, but you can download from https://sketchfab.com)

## Demo Controls

The demo uses command line (or from VS command line argument under the property of the demo project) in order to render.
The demo in fact is a GLTF viewer at the moment, because I'm using it for render purpose only.

General (ION engine) command line arguments:
* -width
	* set the width size of the window
* -height
	* set the height size of the window
* -fullscreen
	* set fullscreen (true or false)
* -showcursor
	* show mouse cursor (true or false)

For instance:	-width 1024 -height 768 -fullscreen true


Demo command line arguments:
* -model
	* load a model, if -usepath IS NOT DEFINED, the model MUST be only the filename and MUST be inside the Assets/Models demo folder
* -primitive
	* load primitives (quad, triangle, cube, sphere)
* -usepath
	* if -usepath is set, you need to specified the fullpath of the model file and can be everywhere 

For instance:	-model DamagedHelmet.gltf
Or:				-usepath -model C:\Users\MyUser\Downloads\DamagedHelmet\DamagedHelmet.gltf


The controls in this demo test are:
* Hold left mouse button in order to rotate the object
* Hold right mouse button in order to pan right or left and up or down the object
* Use the mouse wheel to go toward or far away the object
* Press R to auto rotate the model
* Press A and S to increase or decrease the scale respectively

Pressing the key L, you can change the control from the model to the light
In this case, toggling the L key you will have:
* Hold left mouse button in order to rotate the light
* Hold right mouse button in order to change the direction of the light from right or left and up or down
* Use the mouse wheel in order to change the direction of the light in forward

To Debug PBR (this works just with the 7th test for now because is the only one using the PBR shader)
You need to have defined ION_PBR_DEBUG (by default is defined)
* Press 1, 2 or 3 to change the active value between esposure, gamma or prefiltered cube mip levels
* Press Q or Z to increment or decrement the selected values


## Important

As I wrote before, this is made to learn something about this API.
I got my inspiration from the following persons and their code

### Almost self inclusive

I tried to reduce external dependencies to the minimum.
All the dependencies are inside DEPENDENCIES folder.
The main dependencies at the moment are the memory allocators for CPU and GPU, made by me (Eos and vkMemoryAllocator)
Other dependencies are single file, like json and stb_image


### About dependencies

About how to use the dependencies please take a look to their own owner. (also for the mine!)
